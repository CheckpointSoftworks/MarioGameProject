Sprint number: 									2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: 			Goomba()

*	The Goomba class is about as clean as it can get. The variables are limited to only the Sprite, and the only methods are one-line and utilitarian. 
*	While this implementation is fine for this sprint, eventually the Goomba class is going to need to track its position and life status. But as long as the additions to the class are 
	as to the book as the rest of the class, that won't be a problem.
