Specific comments on code quality:
	- Code quality is okay, but the constructor is completely hardcoded. While this is an artifact of the ISprite class, adding later sprites is going to be a time-consuming process.
	- The values width and height in Draw() don't change, so the reassignments are unnecessary. They should be moved into class fields and set in the constructor.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	- This sprite will go through frames at the same rate that the game updates, so the animation will be extremely fast. A possible new feature would be setting the frames per minute so that each frame of animation can be perceived.
