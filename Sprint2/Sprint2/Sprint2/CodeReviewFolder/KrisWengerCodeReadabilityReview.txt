Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	Almost all of the naming of the variables are easy to understand what they, stand for and what they should do.
	However, there are two variables like camera and mario, which I believe would be better suited to be named
	becuase they match the sent variables to the constructor and that could get confusing.  This could be fixed when initalizing by not calling
	the sent mario and sent camera,	just mario and camera but rather something differnt like sentMario/sentCamera. The calls to outside 
	classes also are readable because the method names, and class names make sense, such as calling	the 
	camera.MoveRight(marioCameraPosistion), makes sense what it should do.  This is true even not knowing what the called methods are,
	the call itself implies what it should it do. It moves the camera right based on Mario. However for the
	part the Camera Controller class seems readable, the Update method is straight foward, the code is not overly long, and
	the method is very short and straight to the point. 
	Overall I believe the class' code is very Readable.
