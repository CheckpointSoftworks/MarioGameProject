Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	The naming of the variables are easy to understand what they, stand for and what they should do.
	However, the use of i as a looping variable could be confusing because it is short and non-descriptive.
	This could be fixed by calling i something like item or something that matches the items List. The calls to outside 
	classes also are readable because the method names, such as i.Update(), makes sense what it should do. 
	However the use of signle line if statements without the curly braces makes it harder to read.  But the class does not
	have any long methods or methods which are overly complicated. Overall I believe the class' code is very Readable.
