Description: I wanted to see how readble this is because of the funny name.  Scott's classes are generally simple, effective,
and easy to read through and re-use.  This class is no different.  We clearly see what the overall point of the class is.  It's a
new camera type in which there will be a lot of shaking and random movements.  We can read though the detailed logic of the code
and get a good general idea of how it works just based on the variable names.
