Comments on Readability:
	First thing I noticed was that the class is pretty long.  However most of the code
	looks necessary.  The arrays including the seperators for x and y (xstringSeparator
	and ystringSeparator) are declared within each if statement and it could reduce the
	length of the code if they were declared somewhere outside of the if statements
	to be reused.  When adding a game object to its respective list, the variable name
	"GameObject" is used when instead it could probably be more specific.  Camel case
	on some of the variables such as "xstring" could be "xString" to help clarity.
	The class overall is very readable but a lot of repeat code makes it a bit long.
