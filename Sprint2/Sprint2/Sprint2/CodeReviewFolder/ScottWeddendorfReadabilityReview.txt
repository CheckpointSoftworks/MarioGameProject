Comments on Readability:
	The class roughly follows the same pattern used in the other blocks in the project which
	helps keep readability consistent.  Variable names are very discriptive and easy to 
	figure out what they are used for.  The only confusion comes from the noLongerSpecialized
	variable.  It is difficult to see what it is used for from the code and a negative in the
	variable name for a boolean can create some confusion.  Two methods are added that are not
	used for other block types.  The methods names, coinCounting and dispenseCoin, fully 
	describe the functions and the logic is very clear.  Overall, a well orgainized class that
	follows patterns established earlier in the project which makes readability very consistent.
