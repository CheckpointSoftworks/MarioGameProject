Comments on Readability:
	The set of classes dealing with game pausing is very simple.  There are two variables that
	are clearly named such that they are named exactly what they do.  The class follows the
	same organization found in other command classes.  Also, the only two variables are bools
	so there is no confusion on what their values are set to.  Overall this class is very
	readable because there are a very few number of variables and lines of code.
