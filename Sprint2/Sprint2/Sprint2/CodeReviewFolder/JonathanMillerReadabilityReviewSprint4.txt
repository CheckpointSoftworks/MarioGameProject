Comments:

ControllablePhysicsObject is a readable class. All of the property, variable, and function names make 
sense. The code follows proper naming conventions. It can be a little tricky to follow because it is a 
little long, but it should be considering that it is the physics engine for Mario. The Clamp functions 
are a little tricky to understand because there are two of them, but they return different types. 
Overall, it is a readable class.
