Specific comments on code quality:
	The class is quite percise in its variable naming conventions.  In terms of maintainability,
	adjusting the camera to follow a different player character other than Mario seems easy
	enough, just in the constructor send a different IPlayer to the controller.  This is the
	same with have the controller control a different player.  So in theory, on could have a camera
	centered around a Mario player and another camera centered around a Luigi player.  In terms of
	dependencies the controller is only really dependent on an IPlayer and a camera, both of which make
	sense since you need the camera to control and the player to know when to move the camera.
	In terms of cohesion the camera controller I would say has high cohesion becuase it is perfroming
	only one task.  It is updating the camera through method calls.  In terms of coupling as stated above
	the class has very few dependencies, so I would also say that the camera contoller has loose coupling.
	Overall, I believe this class has high cohesion and loose coupling.
