Description: As far as quality, i have been very impressed by all of Scott's classes.  They are very easy to use in our own code when
needed.  Basically just a "plug-and-play" type of classes.  For example, for the camera controller I ran into a problem where I needed
to move the camera backwards for my transitions (Skyworld, underground area).  As I stumbled upon fixing the bug, trying different
things to no avail, I realized I would not have to rewrite any sections of the camera classes.  There was already a method built-in
to the class for moving the camera backwards/forwards, and it solved my bug immeditately.  It was a plug-and-play solution to my
problem which existed already in the class, so I was impressed by the quality and forward thinking.  For sprint 6 Scott made
new camera models, that make the camera behave in strange and different ways.  I enjoyed using the camera modes and found them
easy to implement usage of in my own classes although did not end up using them.
