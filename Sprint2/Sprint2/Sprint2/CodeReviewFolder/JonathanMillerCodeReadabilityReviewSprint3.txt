Comments:

This class is well designed. The variable names are easy to understand and the logic flows nicely. 
The chooseCollisionCommand() method should use the Pascal case naming convention though. The use of 
commands make the class easier to read, and the command class names suit each class. The comment in 
the code is subjectively meaningful. Somebody that doesn't know the behavior of blocks in Super Mario
Bros. would find it meaningful. Overall, the class is very readable.
