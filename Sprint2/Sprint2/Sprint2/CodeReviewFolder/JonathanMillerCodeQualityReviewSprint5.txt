Comments:

The BlueBrickBlock class has low coupling and it is cohesive. There are only five fields, and only a few are non-primitve 
types. One of the variables is of type ISprite, which is an interface, so coupling is loose in regard to that. The methods 
are short, simple and easy to read. The class is reusable because it could be used as a class for different block types. 
All you would have to do is change the class name, sprite, and type enum value to reflect the new block. It is also easy 
to change the location of the block because the X and Y locations are passed as arguments in the constructor. Overall, 
the class is well designed.
