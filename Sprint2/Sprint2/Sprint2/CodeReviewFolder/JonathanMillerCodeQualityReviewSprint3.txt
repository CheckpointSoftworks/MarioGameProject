Comments:

This class is organized very well, and the quality of the code is good. The code is cohesive, because all parameters
in each method relate to each other. The parameters are all needed to handle the collision between mario and blocks.
There is a medium amount of coupling due to the nature of a collision handler class. Each method in the class
correctly does what it is supposed to do in a minimal manner. I do think that the method names should be using the 
Pascal case naming convention though. The class is maintainable despite the medium amount of coupling. For instance, 
if we wanted to change the size and/or texture of the blocks and/or Mario, the collision detection would still work
correctly and nothing would need to be changed in this class.
