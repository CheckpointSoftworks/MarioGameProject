Comments:

Overall, this class of good coding quality. There are only five necessary fields, three constructor arguments, and a 
minimal amount of necessary methods that all cohesively work together to spawn the right enemy. The coupling is also 
low with the class only depending on two non-primitive fields, one of which is an interface. The Draw and Update 
methods are minimal by just updating the spawnerSprite and spawn timer logic and drawing the spawnerSprite. The 
SpawnAnEnemy method is minimal by only needing a single if-else statement to determine which enemy is spawned and 
where to spawn it. The class also doesn't have any magic numbers because it uses the Utility class. The class could be 
easily adjusted to include more types of enemies that could spawn from the spawner. Overall, it is a well designed 
class.
