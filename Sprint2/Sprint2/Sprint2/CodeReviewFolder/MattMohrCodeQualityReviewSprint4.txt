Comments:
Cohesion is excellent with sprites being handled by a state pattern, physics handled by a rigidbody component, collisions are received and sent to the rigidbody. Collision events are available in Goomba if a state change needs to occur besides TakeDamage
Feature:
A potential feature to add would be to make LoadRigidBodyProperties a helper class. Maybe Ridibody could be a factory that loads the properties of enemies instead of having to hardcode the values into each enemy.
