Details:

Goomba now uses an autonomous physics object class to handle of its motion, which is new. It also uses a state-based system instead of handling its sprite by itself.
Readibility is pretty high as well. The only weird numbers come from the physics object, but those are all physical properties of Goomba. 
At just under 100 lines, this is a very readable class.
