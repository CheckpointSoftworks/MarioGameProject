Specific notes: Code quality is good. returnLocation() should just be a property called Location though. Other than that, the cohesion is pretty tight and the coupling is quite loose.
Additional features: Because this and the fireflower are so similar, it may be best to just have a generic Flower class with a Flower Type instead of repeating the same code.
