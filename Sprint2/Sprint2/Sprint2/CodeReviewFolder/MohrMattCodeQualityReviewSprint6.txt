Sprint number: 5
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: SoundEffectFactory.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:  Scott Weddendorf
Specific notes: It's an exemplar factory pattern class, so coupling is high but cohesion is perfectly tight. 
Additional feature: Again, it's a factory pattern, so there isn't much to add. Potentially, it could report when a file has stopped playing for looping puproses, but that's more up to the sound class' code.
