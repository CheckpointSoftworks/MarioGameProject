Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 5 minutes.
Details:
Everything that has been changed is readable and makes sense.  The collision stuff got a little bit out of control but appears to have been all
fixed succinctly.  Not much more to say about this series of classes at this point.  We may update them a bit for sprint 6.  All of the code
files are short and to the point.  All of the variables are necessary and no magic numbers or strategies are used.
