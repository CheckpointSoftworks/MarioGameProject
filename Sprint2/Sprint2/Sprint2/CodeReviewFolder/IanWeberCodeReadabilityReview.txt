The class uses good names for all variable names and function names, following
the proper conventions provided.  Comments that were not 100% necessary were removed,
which makes the code more readable.  As stated before, the intermediate programmer can
easily read this class for the first time and understand how it fits into the overall
big picture of the code body.  This is a sign of code that will be maintainable in the future,
since developers will be able to understand the code easily without having to read into it
too much.  For example, since the function calls are well-named, this adds an immediate level
of understanding to what the code is supposed to do -- then, the reader can read the actual
code body for a detailed explanation of how the logic of the code works.  There is a high
level of cohesion within the class and a low level of coupling with other classes in the solution.
