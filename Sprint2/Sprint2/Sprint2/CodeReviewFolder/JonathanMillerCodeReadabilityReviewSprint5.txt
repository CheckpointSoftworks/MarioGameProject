Comments:

This class is well organized. It's very readable. The method and variable names are named appropriately. The methods are 
simple and easy to read; they are straightforward. All of the methods don't follow the same naming convention though. It 
would be preferable if they all were using Pascal Case. Overall, it's a very readable class.
