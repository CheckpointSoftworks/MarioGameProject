Comments on Quality:
	The class has is very organized with clear variable names and method names and has good
	cohesion.  All of the methods are very specific and relate closely to the block type.
	The methods only deal with keeping track of various variables and states for the coin 
	dispenser and one method creates the box coin needed within the dispenser.  There is very
	little to no coupling.  The only dependency is the corresponding sprite class which is 
	obviously necessary.  One potential change would be to allow the number of coins in the 
	box to be set to different values or for the box to stay active for a certain amount of 
	time after it has been hit the first time.  Overall, because of high cohesion and low
	coupling the class has good maintainablity and functionality.
