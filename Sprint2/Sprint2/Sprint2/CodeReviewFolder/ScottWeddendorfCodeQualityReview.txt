Specific comments on code quality:
	Code is still very readable.  Clear variable names and simple draw logic.  One change that the spriteSheetSprite 
	size variable name could be changed to spriteSize and could be declared when the class is created as the variable
	is currently being initialized with every draw call.  One change to the game that could affect the class is that
	some of the pipes allow for mario to enter them and others do not.  Implementing this mechanic would be as simple
	as adding a bool variable stating that the pipe is interactable or not.
