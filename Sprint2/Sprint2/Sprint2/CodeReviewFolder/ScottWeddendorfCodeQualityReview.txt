Comments on Quality:
	The code still has a lot of reused lines that could possibly be condensed.  However, these lines
	should not need to be altered so it doesn't create any difficulties for maintainability.  
	Currently, the class has an "if" case for every object being loaded into the game.  In the future
	when there could possibly be hundreds of different objects to be added, this class could get
	bloated.  It could possibly be changed to accept new types of objects and load them using much of
	the same code.  This might be done by creating a method to handle the loading given the class type
	as an argument.
