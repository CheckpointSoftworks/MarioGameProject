Comments:

The ControllablePhysicsObject class is well written. It has low coupling because it just uses primitive types and Vector2 
objects. The cohesion is high because all of the local variables and function parameters are just used in physics 
calculations and logic flow. The class is a little long though because of all the properties and functions. It is 
maintainable, but may be time consuming due to the length and amount of variables. It could be reusable for other physics 
engines in other games of similar genre. A hypothetical change related to Mario's physics would be to make Mario jump 
higher or run faster. It would be easy to make the changes because the properties could easily be set to a 
different value.
