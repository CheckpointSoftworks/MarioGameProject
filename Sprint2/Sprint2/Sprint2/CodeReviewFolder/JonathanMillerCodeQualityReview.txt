This class is organized well. It uses proper naming conventions for all 
variables, methods, and classes. The class is maintainable since the textures 
are chosen in the BlockSpiteTextureStorage class. So if we wanted to change 
textures for the block, the only changes would be inside of the Draw() method. 
Since the frame size is hard-coded into the animation, you would need to change 
spriteSheetSpriteSize if individual frame sizes are different in the new Brick 
Block texture. Also, the new frames would need to be perefectly square since 
spriteSheetSpriteSize is used for the width and the height. The "smashed" Brick 
Block frame would need to be in the same location. There are also some un-needed 
parentheses around spriteSheetSpriteSize in the Draw() method. Overall, it is 
maintainable, but there will need to be some changes in the Draw() method if you 
want a new texture that doesn't follow the same formatting as the original 
texture.
