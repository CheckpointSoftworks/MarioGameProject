Description: Still has the public and private booleans representing Mario's state.  This is fine for now because we have the additional classes in the
MarioStateClasses folder for "helping" the Mario class achieve it's different state changes.  Not much has changed with the class but I took this time 
re-read the MarioStateClasses and think about how we can tidy them up further and reduce coupling with the Mario class and vice-versa.  The state
transition errors from before appear to be fixed upon testing, they must have been hard to catch because I didn't even realize them occurring
for sprint 2 and certainly didn't spot them in the code.  One last thing is star still needs to be split into a concrete subclass, but I believe
we agreed to keep things as is for sprint3.   All said, Mario is still one of our more readable and easily maintainable classes.  For future
reviews I'll make sure to review the whole of the Mario state-related classes and not just Mario.
