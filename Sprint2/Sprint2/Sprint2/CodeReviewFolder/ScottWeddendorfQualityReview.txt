	The class has very low coupling which is good for maintainability.  The only dependency 
	is Game1 which is typical for command classes.  The coupling is tight with the Game1 
	class as calls are made to directly alter variables in the Game1 class.  However, this
	is necessary for command classes.  The class is very simple and follows the guidlines 
	and patterns that have been used for other command classes in the project which is good 
	for readability of the code.  Overall, the class is of good quality as it is cohesive 
	and has low coupling.  One possible improvement for the class would be to add a class
	for a pause state that is called in the command so a pause menu could be added in the 
	future.
