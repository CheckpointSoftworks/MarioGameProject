	First, the class is pretty long.  This however is necessary due to the nature of having 
	a list of achievements.  There is also a lot of branching but it is also necessary and
	it does not go past two levels so it is not a problem.  The class has high cohesion as 
	it only deals with the achievement system.  The class also has low coupling as there are
	no dependencies.  Overall, the class has very good quality as it is readable and has high
	cohesion and low coupling.
