Comments:

Overall, this class is readable. All of the variables and methods are named appropriately. The constructor logic is 
easy to understand. When an EnemySpawner object is instantiated, it is passed a bool which determines which enemy the 
spawner will spawn. If a true bool is passed to the constructor, then the SpawnAnEnemy method spawns a Goomba. If a 
false bool is passed to the constructor, then the SpawnAnEnemy method spawns a Koopa. The class is well organized and 
easy to understand.
