Number of minutes taken to complete the review:  12 mins to write all the review, 3 or 4 mins only to read the code.
Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	The naming of the variables are easy to understand what they, stand for and what they should do.
	However, the use of sw for stream writer may be confusing but it makes since since sw is short for stream writer.
	This could be simply fixed by changing sw to something like statsFileWriter or something along that lines. 
	The short methods for the class make it much easier to read and the naming of the outside methods also make
	understaning the code easy. Overall I believe the PlayerStatManager's code to be very Readable.
