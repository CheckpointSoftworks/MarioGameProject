Comments on Readability:
	The code is well organized with all of the achievement types.  It is easy to see which
	section of the code deals with which achievements.  All of the methods in the class are
	well named and once again help with organization and readability when they are used in 
	other methods.  There are quiet a few variables but they are well named.  Each one is 
	pretty much named what it is or does. Overall, the class is very readable as the code 
	organization allows easy recognition of the patterns of the code.
